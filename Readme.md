#   Dice Challenge

This Dice Challenge project is a simple game built using JavaScript where two dice are rolled, and the result determines the winner or if it's a draw. The project uses the Math.random() function to generate random dice rolls and dynamically updates the DOM to display the dice images and the game outcome.


## Features

1. Random Dice Rolls:
Each player’s dice roll is randomly generated using JavaScript's Math.random() function, producing a number between 1 and 6.

2. Dynamic Image Updates:
Based on the generated number, the corresponding dice images are updated dynamically in the browser, providing visual feedback of the dice roll.

3. Winner Determination:
If Player 1’s roll is greater, Player 1 wins.
If Player 2’s roll is greater, Player 2 wins.
If both rolls are the same, it results in a draw.

4. Instant Result Display:
The winner (or draw) is displayed instantly at the top of the page, giving immediate feedback after each roll.

5. User-Friendly Interface:
The game’s results are displayed clearly, and the dice images visually represent the outcome for a fun, engaging experience.

6. Simple Refresh Mechanism:
Users can refresh the page or rerun the game to roll the dice again and see new results instantly.
